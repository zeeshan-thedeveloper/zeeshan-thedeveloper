- 👋 Hi, I’m Zeeshan 
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I have been working on variety of projects with different types of technologies.   For example i have recently created an university  project based  (web based).
 In that project i have focused 3 tier architecture and created my own  node express framework based API (RESTfull  API) along with authentication APIs of firebase. 
Other than this project i was  the lead of a team of a firebase database design. And that project was presented in MUET University and won the 1st prize. Other then
this i have created 4 android applications for my learning purpose which were able to fetch and send data to firebase database and mysql database. I have not done 
only these web based projects but i have created multiple desktop applications for my university projects and few fiver's projects aswell. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on APIs (Express JS, Java Spring)
