## üöÄ About Me

Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Full Stack Development**, I specialize in training, fine-tuning, and optimizing AI models for real-world applications. My current focus revolves around **LLM model training, AI research, NLP, and cloud-based AI deployment**.

With a strong background in **MERN Stack, backend architecture, and mobile development**, I have experience building scalable web applications using **React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js**. Additionally, I have worked with **Java, C++, C#, and GraphQL**, gaining hands-on expertise in diverse software development environments.

I am always exploring new frontiers in AI, from **model fine-tuning and inference optimization** to **LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow & PyTorch**.
